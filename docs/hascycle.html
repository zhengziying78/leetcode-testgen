    <h1>Test Case Generation for Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>This document describes a method for generating test cases for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection" target="_blank">cycle detection algorithms in directed graphs</a>. The approach constructs graphs with known ground truth by tracking which edges would form cycles during the construction process.</p>
    
    <h2>2. The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Testing cycle detection implementations is difficult because common approaches lead to circular reasoning. For example, comparing the output of one HasCycle() implementation against another requires trusting that the reference implementation is correct—but that's exactly what we're trying to verify.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Algorithm</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Key Insight</h3>
    <p>The solution uses a constructive method that builds directed graphs while explicitly tracking cycle-forming potential. The key insight is that we can know the test oracle (i.e., whether the generated graph has cycles or not) <strong>deterministically</strong> without running any HasCycle() algorithm—the ground truth is established by construction.</p>
    
    <h3>3.2 Edge Classification</h3>
    <p>During construction, edges are classified into two categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blue edges:</strong> Safe edges that don't complete any cycles</li>
        <li><strong>Red edges:</strong> Edges that would complete a cycle if added</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This classification allows us to generate test cases with guaranteed properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graphs with only blue edges are guaranteed to be acyclic</li>
        <li>Graphs where some red edges are converted to blue are guaranteed to contain cycles</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.3 Algorithm Steps</h3>
    <p>The algorithm works as follows:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Generate a random integer <em>N</em> and create an <em>N</em>-node directed graph with no edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge Selection:</strong> Randomly select a pair of nodes <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> such that edge <em>X→Y</em> does not exist in the current graph.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue Edge Addition:</strong> Add edge <em>X→Y</em> to the graph and classify it as a blue edge (cycle-safe edge).</li>
        <li><strong>Red Edge Identification:</strong> Identify and add all red edges. A red edge represents the final edge needed to complete a cycle where all other edges in the cycle are blue.</li>
        <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeat steps 2-4 for a predetermined number of iterations or until no additional blue edges can be added.</li>
        <li><strong>Acyclic Graph Generation:</strong> To generate an acyclic graph, remove all red edges from the construction. The resulting graph containing only blue edges is guaranteed to be cycle-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyclic Graph Generation:</strong> To generate a cyclic graph, randomly convert one or more red edges to blue edges, then remove all remaining red edges. The resulting graph is guaranteed to contain at least one cycle.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>3.4 Red Edge Identification Algorithm</h3>
    <p>The critical component of this method is the systematic identification of red edges in step 4. Given a newly added blue edge <em>X→Y</em>, we determine all potential cycle-completing edges as follows:</p>
    
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li><strong>Forward Reachability:</strong> Compute the set of all nodes reachable from <em>Y</em> using only blue edges, including <em>Y</em> itself. Denote this set as <em>from-Y</em>. This is accomplished through forward traversal of the blue edge subgraph starting from <em>Y</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Backward Reachability:</strong> Compute the set of all nodes from which <em>X</em> is reachable using only blue edges, including <em>X</em> itself. Denote this set as <em>to-X</em>. This is accomplished through reverse traversal of the blue edge subgraph terminating at <em>X</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Red Edge Construction:</strong> For each node <em>i</em> ∈ <em>from-Y</em> (i.e., <em>i</em> is in the set <em>from-Y</em>) and each node <em>j</em> ∈ <em>to-X</em> (i.e., <em>j</em> is in the set <em>to-X</em>), create a red edge <em>i→j</em>. Each such edge, when combined with the existing blue edges, would complete exactly one cycle.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>4. Illustrative Example</h2>
    <p>We demonstrate the algorithm through a concrete example with an 11-node directed graph (where 11 was randomly picked as the graph size).</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Initialization</h3>
    <p>Generate an 11-node directed graph with no edges:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-01.png" alt="Figure 1: 11-node graph with no arcs" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h3>Step 2: First Edge Addition</h3>
    <p>Randomly select nodes A and K. Add blue edge A→K. Apply the red edge identification algorithm: since <em>from-K</em> = {K} and <em>to-A</em> = {A}, we add red edge K→A. This red edge would complete the cycle A→K→A:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-02.png" alt="Figure 2: Adding first blue arc A->K and red arc K->A" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h3>Step 3: Second Edge Addition</h3>
    <p>Add blue edge B→A. For this edge, <em>from-A</em> = {A, K} and <em>to-B</em> = {B}. Therefore, we add red edges A→B and K→B. Edge A→B would complete cycle B→A→B, while edge K→B would complete cycle B→A→K→B:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-03.png" alt="Figure 3: Adding second blue arc B->A with red arcs A->B and K->B" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h3>Step 4: Continued Edge Addition</h3>
    <p>When blue edge G→H is added, we compute <em>from-H</em> = {H} and <em>to-G</em> = {G, A, B}. This results in red edges H→G, H→A, and H→B, each completing a distinct cycle:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-04.png" alt="Figure 4: Adding blue arc G->H with red arcs H->G, H->A, H->B" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h3>Step 5: Complex Red Edge Identification</h3>
    <p>Consider the addition of blue edge G→F to a more complex graph state:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-05.png" alt="Figure 5: Adding blue arc G->F" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <p>For this edge, we compute <em>from-F</em> = {F, C, E} and <em>to-G</em> = {G, A, B}. The algorithm generates nine red edges: F→G, F→A, F→B, C→G, C→A, C→B, E→G, E→A, E→B:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-06.png" alt="Figure 6: Graph with all red arcs added" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-07.png" alt="Figure 7: Detailed view of red arcs" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-08.png" alt="Figure 8: Complete graph with blue and red arcs" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h3>Step 6: Complete Graph Construction</h3>
    <p>After multiple iterations, the algorithm produces a graph containing both blue and red edges:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-09.png" alt="Figure 9: Final graph with all blue and red arcs" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h2>5. Test Case Generation</h2>
    
    <h3>Acyclic Test Cases</h3>
    <p>To generate an acyclic directed graph, remove all red edges from the construction. The resulting graph contains only blue edges and is guaranteed to be cycle-free:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-10.png" alt="Figure 10: Graph without cycles (red arcs removed)" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h3>Cyclic Test Cases</h3>
    <p>To generate a cyclic directed graph, randomly select one or more red edges and convert them to blue edges, then remove all remaining red edges. For example, converting edge C→A to blue creates cycle A→G→F→C→A:</p>
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-11.png" alt="Figure 11: Converting red arc C->A to blue" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <img src="images/hascycle/fig-12.png" alt="Figure 12: Final graph with cycle A->G->F->C->A" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    
    <h2>6. Completeness and Coverage</h2>
    <p>This method provides comprehensive coverage of all possible directed graph configurations. The algorithm can generate graphs with zero, single, or multiple cycles by systematically controlling the conversion of red edges to blue edges. The constructive approach ensures that the ground truth (presence or absence of cycles) is known by design, eliminating the need for potentially unreliable reference implementations.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We have presented a systematic approach for generating random test cases for cycle detection algorithms in directed graphs. The method addresses the fundamental challenge of establishing ground truth without circular reasoning, providing a robust foundation for testing cycle detection implementations across diverse graph topologies.</p>
