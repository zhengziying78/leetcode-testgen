    <h1>LeetCode Test Case Generator</h1>
    
    <blockquote>
        "For many times, I found that testing a solution could be equally hard as writing a solution, if not harder."
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>This repository demonstrates that <strong>generating comprehensive test cases for algorithmic problems can be as challenging as solving the problems themselves</strong>. While most developers focus on implementing solutions, creating robust test cases often requires deep algorithmic thinking and creative problem-solving.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project systematically explores test case generation algorithms for LeetCode problems, starting with the first 200-300 problems. For each problem, we develop and implement algorithms that can generate random, comprehensive test cases without simply reimplementing the original solution (which would be a "circular proof").</p>
    
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>The inspiration for this project comes from the complexity encountered when trying to generate test cases for seemingly simple problems. For example, generating test cases for a "detect cycle in directed graph" problem requires sophisticated graph construction techniques to ensure proper coverage of both cyclic and acyclic scenarios.</p>
    
    <p>As explored in detail in <a href="hascycle.html">this example</a>, effective test case generation often involves:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoiding circular reasoning</strong>: Not reimplementing the solution to verify correctness</li>
        <li><strong>Ensuring comprehensive coverage</strong>: Generating edge cases and boundary conditions</li>
        <li><strong>Maintaining algorithmic soundness</strong>: Using mathematically valid approaches to construct test inputs</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling complexity</strong>: Creating test cases of varying difficulty and size</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: Cycle Detection Test Case Generation</h2>
    <p>One of the most illustrative examples is generating test cases for cycle detection in directed graphs. The challenge isn't just creating random graphsâ€”it's systematically creating graphs where you can control and verify the presence or absence of cycles without reimplementing cycle detection.</p>
    
    <p>The solution involves:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Strategic edge classification (red/blue arcs)</li>
        <li>Reachability analysis for cycle formation</li>
        <li>Controlled graph construction to ensure known outcomes</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Educational</strong>: Demonstrate the complexity and importance of thorough test case design</li>
        <li><strong>Practical</strong>: Provide reusable test case generators for common algorithmic patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical</strong>: Document the algorithmic thinking required for each problem's test generation</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive</strong>: Cover a wide range of LeetCode problem types and difficulty levels</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>Each problem implementation should include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The test case generation algorithm</li>
        <li>Analysis of why naive approaches fail</li>
        <li>Examples of generated test cases</li>
        <li>Documentation of the underlying mathematical/algorithmic principles</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/zhengziying78/leetcode-testgen.git
cd leetcode-testgen
# Follow individual problem README files for specific instructions</code></pre>
    
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>This project operates on the principle that <strong>good testing requires as much algorithmic sophistication as good solving</strong>. By treating test case generation as a first-class algorithmic challenge, we can build better, more reliable software while deepening our understanding of the underlying problems.</p>
