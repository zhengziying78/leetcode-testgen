This project demonstrates that **testing a solution can be as challenging as building the solution itself**.

To test a solution, we develop algorithms to generate test cases without reimplementing original solutions, avoiding "circular proof" while ensuring proper coverage. For example, generating test cases for cycle detection requires a graph construction algorithm to control outcomes without reimplementing cycle detection itself.
